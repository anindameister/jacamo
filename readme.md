2. Multiple agents coordinating by communication

#### 2.1. Tentative 1

- multi(2 agents) but no coordination

2.2. Tentative 2

- multi(2 agents) but co-ordination has been established

2.3. Tentative 3
The previous solution has a weakness: bob is strongly directing the execution of alice since this agent achieves any goal say sent from another agent.

In order to coordinate the two agents, instead of commanding alice, bob can only warns it that it has finished its task.

- multi(2 agents) but co-ordination has been established with an additional of the removal of commands and just letting self statis know

```
.send(giacomo,achieve,go)
```

1. run the project
2. something is stuck
3. put whatever
4. put the code
```
.send(giacomo,achieve,go)
```
